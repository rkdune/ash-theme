Listen well, you green recruits—you think you know war because you've drawn blood in training yards and border skirmishes, but the Harkonnen will teach you the true meaning of savagery. These are not honorable enemies who follow the codes of battle; they are flesh-dealers who torture for sport, who feed prisoners to their pet gladiators, who turn children into servitors and leave families to starve in the slave pits of Giedi Prime. I've seen their handiwork—cities reduced to ash not for strategic value but for the pleasure of watching innocents burn, captives flayed alive to extract information they already possessed, entire bloodlines extinguished to satisfy a baron's momentary whim. You'll face an enemy that knows no restraint, no mercy, no limit to the depths of cruelty they'll plumb, and if you hesitate even once thinking they might show you quarter, you'll find yourself begging for death long before they grant it.
