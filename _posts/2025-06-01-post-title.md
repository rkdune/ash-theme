You're thinking like a duke's son instead of a dead man, young master—that pretty bladework might dazzle the court instructors, but it'll get your throat opened by the first Harkonnen killer who doesn't give a damn about form. You telegraphed that thrust like a guild navigator plotting a course, gave me three full heartbeats to read your intention and choose how I wanted to kill you. In real combat, you won't face opponents who'll pause to admire your technique or give you time to recover from a stumble. You dropped your guard after that combination because you thought it was finished, but a fight ends when your enemy stops breathing, not when you decide you've done enough. The blade is your life, Paul—when you hold it casually, you're treating your life casually. Your father's enemies won't hesitate to put steel between your ribs while you're congratulating yourself on a clean strike. Again, and this time fight like the alternative is watching House Atreides burn while you bleed out in the sand.
