The spice must flow, but so must Harkonnen blood when they come for it—and they will come hard and fast before we've had time to properly read the desert's moods. We hold Arrakeen and the northern settlements, but that's castle-thinking on a planet where the real power lies in controlling the deep desert harvesting operations. The Harkonnen know every smuggler route, every sietch entrance they've bought with torture and bribes over eighty years of occupation. Our advantage lies in Duke Leto's pledge to the Fremen—if we can earn their trust quickly, we gain twenty thousand fighters who know this desert like their own bloodstream, plus knowledge of water sources the Harkonnen never found. But we're vulnerable during the transition period: our off-world equipment isn't desert-tested, our men don't understand the sand's killing power, and Baron Vladimir will strike fast to prevent any Fremen alliance from solidifying. We need mobile defense—fast ornithopters for early warning, spice harvester escorts that can double as troop transports, and underground supply caches at every major spice blow. The moment we try to defend fixed positions in this vastness, we're dead.
